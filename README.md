# basic-social-media-app
This app is a backend application that hosts API endpoints for a basic social media app. It uses a MongoDB database to store information such as User, Friend, Thought, and Reaction data. It was a good practice with MongoDB and the <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/">MongooseJS</a>.

## What was the point
As I mentioned above, one of the motivations to build this app was to practice using MongoDB and Mongoose along with expressJS.

## Improvements
* Add more models
* Remove the _id field from the reaction model
* Add a seeds file for quick test data
